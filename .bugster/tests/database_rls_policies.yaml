name: Database RLS Policies
page: various
page_path: database functions
task: Verify Row Level Security policies protect user data appropriately
steps:
- Login with one user account
- Access your profile, challenges, rewards, and chat history
- Verify you can only see your own data
- Navigate to another user's potential data points (if UI allows attempting)
- Verify you cannot access another user's data
- Test creating a new challenge completion
- Verify the data is properly associated with your user ID
- Test with multiple user accounts if available
- Verify each user only sees their own information
- Verify that data isolation is maintained across all features (challenges, rewards, profile, chat)
expected_result: RLS policies properly restrict access so users can only view and modify their own data
